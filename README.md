Playing around with SDR code in Java

This is my first time entering the SDR world.  I hope for this to someday be used to build streaming media server or media device.  For now, it's a pile of hacky code.

Broadcast FM Stereo is working except for maybe audio level compensation.
RDS, which would be critical for a media device, is a lousy work in progress.
AM, narrow band FM, SDR interfacing, and tuning multiple stations from wideband sampling are TODO.

Hey, SDRPlay.  Document the damn network API for your nRSP-ST.
